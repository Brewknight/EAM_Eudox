# Eudoxus Evaluation

## Top 4 Usablity Issues

* Extended usage of text, right in the middle of the screen. It's common knowledge, that the user does **not read** but **scans** instead.
* The font used is especially small, quite so in the side-navigation bar individual links. Also, the coloring choices are very poor.
* The title does not **explicitly** reflect the application's purpose. It uses many and mostly unnecessary words, that the user should not be obliged to read.

* It cannot be easily ascertained where the individual links lead to. In addition, many links can be confused with one another, when it comes to their usage or destination.

**Honorable Mention**: It *can* be hard for each target group to discern where their goal lies.

## Nielsen's Laws Broken

* No breadcrumbs functionality. Very hard to nagivate through the multitude of unnecessary pages. <span style ="color:magenta">**Visibility**</span>
