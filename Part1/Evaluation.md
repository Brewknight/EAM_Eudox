# Eudoxus Evaluation

## Top 5 Usablity Issues

* Noisy, ungraceful design.
* Extensive usage of text, right in the middle of the screen. It's common knowledge, that the user does **not read** but **scans** instead.
* The font used is especially small, quite so in the side-navigation bar individual links. Also, the coloring choices are very poor.
* The title does not **explicitly** reflect the application's purpose. It uses many and mostly unnecessary words, that the user should not be obliged to read.<br>

* It cannot be easily ascertained where the individual links lead to. In addition, many links can be confused with one another, when it comes to their usage or destination.

**Honorable Mention**: It *can* be hard for each target group to discern where their goal lies.

## Nielsen's Laws Broken

1. There is no way for the user to trace back his actions. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Visibility of System Status | Control** </span>
2. Links used in text sections do not have the color determined by convention. They are <span style="color:orange">orange</span>, rather than <span style="color:cornflowerblue">blue</span>. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Consistency and Standards** </span>
3. Non-explicit and clear links to individual functionalities for each target group. <span style="color:cyan">**Aesthetic and minimalist design | Recognition rather than recall**</span>
4. Extensive use of text, intertwined with big chunks of *useless* information. <span style="color:cyan">**Aesthetic and minimalist design**</span>
5. Blurry, Different-styled icons, inconsistent subtitles. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Consistency | Aesthetic and minimalist design** </span>
6. The FAQ section is badly written. One cannot easily find the answer to his possible inquiries. Moreover, the incorrect usage of color causes eye strain. <span style="color:cyan">**Help and Documentation**</span>
7. The user upon clicking on a side-bar link, instead of being immediately transported to the expected destination, is taken to a proxy page and has to click a very similar link in order to finally reach his destination. <span style="color:cyan">**Flexibility and Efficiency**</span>
8. The informational videos are oddly placed and thus, most users will gloss over them. Although one (Eudoxus+ Video) is clear and concise, it could be deemed as old-fashioned. <span style="color:cyan">**Recognition rather than recall | Help and documentation**</span>
9. The "General Textbook Database" page in addition to the "Selected Textbooks" page are cluttered and make it difficult for one to find what one's looking for. <span style="color:cyan">**Efficiency | Aesthetic and Minimalist design**</span>
10. Searching functionality on textbook database does not prevent possible spelling mistakes and offers no insight or prediction on the probable search results. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Error Prevention | Recognition rather than recall** </span>
11. Every individual application connected to the website (Textbook Trading, Login pages for each target-group, e.t.c) is completely different to every other application. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Consistency** </span>
12. Although the individual applications connected to the website, though definitely functional, have an old-fashioned "feel" to them. <span style ="color:cyan"> **Aesthetic and Minimalist design** </span>  
13. These links do **not** draw the user's attention to the appropriate place.<br>

## Possible Solutions

1. Breadcrumb functionality.
2. Usage of correct colour convention.
3. Distinct sections for each user with appropriate sub-menus/pages. <br>
    Proposed Solutions:
    * Radial Menu with color-coded sections for each target-group.
        
        <img src="./images/radial.png" width="250" height="250">

        (a work **very** much in progress)
    * Target group sections (grid)
4. Said text contains information about the innovation "achieved" by the website, its history, and other, not immediately useful information. This kind of text could be placed in a section/tab of its own. For example "About Us", or something of the sort.
5. Use of minimalistic and clearly presented icons, that reflect exactly their function. Subtitles can be avoided, though they are sometimes useful, especially with higher age groups.
6. Firstly, the website should be clear enough, as to not rely on a FAQ section. Nevertheless, the FAQ section could be remodelled as such:
   * The whole section could be organized into more and inclusive categories
   * The individual questions should be more concise if not based completetly on <span style="color: orange">**keywords**</span> with special highlighting.
7. Depth reduction, via the removal of certain useless "proxy pages", and the introduction of **clear** and **explicit** links.
8. The informational videos should be moved to an "About Us" or "Help" section if not be completely scrapped as a feature. Moreover, they could be made shorter, and certainly be updated to a more modern style.
9. Introduction of efficient search filters and a more pleasing presentation of search results.
10. When typing into the search bar, the system could display possible predicted outcomes which would in turn eliminate spelling mistakes.
11. Every individual application should be implemented from the ground up, in order to maintain aesthetic consistency.
12. A renewed/modern design following minimalistic standards would not only make the users feel comfortable when using the site but also would contribute towards the site's accessibility. It should be noted that these applications are the **Alpha and the Omega** of the site and their functional design should be a priority.
13. These links **do** draw the user's attention to the appropriate place.<br>

14. Alternative website titles:
    * ### Textbook Management Service
    * ### Υπηρεσία Διαχείρισης Συγγραμάτων
